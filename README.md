# LEARNING PATH TO DATA STRUCTURES FROM BEGINNER TO ADVANCE
A complete guide to start with the basic data structure and go through some advance data structures.
## Basics Of Data Structures
Choosing the correct data structure or algorithm to solve a particular problem affects a lot on the efficiency of the solution.
## Linked Lists

   1. **[Insertion of a node in singly linked list.](https://github.com/kkverma/Data-Structures/blob/master/LinkedList.cpp)**
      - at the beginning
      - at the end 
      - at the specified position
   2. **[Deletion of a node in singly linked list.](https://github.com/kkverma/Data-Structures/blob/master/LinkedList.cpp)**
      - from the beginning
      - from the end
      - from the specified position
   3. **[Delete the linked list](https://github.com/kkverma/Data-Structures/blob/master/LinkedList.cpp)**
   4. **[Reverse the linked list](https://github.com/kkverma/Data-Structures/blob/master/LinkedList.cpp)**
   5. **[Detect loop in a linked list](https://github.com/kkverma/Data-Structures/blob/master/LinkedList.cpp)**
      - Method 1: Use Hashing
      - Method 2: Floyd's cycle detection
      
   6. **Union and Intersection of two unsorted list**
   7. **Union and Intersection of two sorted list**
   8. **Flattening of a linked list**
