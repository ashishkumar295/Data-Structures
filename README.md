# LEARNING PATH TO DATA STRUCTURES FROM BEGINNER TO ADVANCE
A complete guide to start with the basic data structure and go through some advance data structures.
## Basics Of Data Structures
Choosing the correct data structure or algorithm to solve a particular problem affects a lot on the efficiency of the solution.
## Linked Lists
   1. **Insertion of a node in singly linked list.**
      - at the beginning
      - at the end 
      - at the specified position
   2. **Deletion of a node in singly linked list.**
      - from the beginning
      - from the end
      - from the specified position
   3. **Delete the linked list**
   4. **Reverse the linked list**
   5. **Detect loop in a linked list**
      - Method 1: Use Hashing
      - Method 2: Floyd's cycle detection
      
   6. **Union and Intersection of two unsorted list**
   7. **Union and Intersection of two sorted list**
   8. **Flattening of a linked list**
